<h2>Friday Feb 15 2008</h2>


<b>First day out!</b>
<br><br>Good ride; I have been getting fat and out of shape from these goofy computers, but my return to the gym two weeks ago has helped me a little. (Thanks for pushing me Mary!)

<br><br>I was very nervous at first... Would I be too cold? Would I make it there on time? Are these goofy car drivers going to hit me?

<br><br>Hell I made it to work at 8:59, my earliest arrival all week (pedal past the DAMN TRAFFIC JAMS). My body feels good; I am alert ready for work and I feel at peace (no frustration from horn blowing idiots).

<br><br>I missed the turn onto Morrisville Parkway (see commute map) which was a BIG mistake. Right around there 54 gets nasty. No shoulder, construction, and late for work people make it a bad place to ride. I will be taking the parkway to Davis Drive from now on. 

<br><br>All in all a good experience... and a morning commute I can look forward to. Lets hope for good weather on Monday!

<br><br><br><b>The ride back</b>
<br><br>Both ways on the first day! I did not think I would be able to pull it off on my first day riding in almost a year.

<br><br>I started home on Davis Drive and hit Morrisville Parkway to get to Hwy 54. Davis is nice, but it has those long not so steap grades that make me wish I was riding the Idor <a class="reglink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_gear">fixed gear</a> I rode for so long.

<br><br>The ride up Morrisville parkway was nice (much better than the section of 54 it helps me avoid), but there is a <b>killer</b> hill at the very end. The hill would not be so bad but my Pops (No Pain Pedal Power AHands) has a nice touring bike with no dang grannie gear! A 2:1 ratio fixie rider like me needs to spin up those steep ones.

<br><br>Got home in about in about 1hr45mins... I slowed it down a bit once I got into Cary (I felt home free). All in all not a bad way to close the work week.

<h2>Stay tuned&hellip</h2>
